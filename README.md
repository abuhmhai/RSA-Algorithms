Currently, data is generated and collected on a massive scale from
various sources, including mobile devices, personal computers, servers, IoT
sensors, and social media systems.
However, managing and securing data has become a significant
challenge for organizations and individuals. Data security has become
increasingly critical. The RSA algorithm is one of the important algorithms
forencrypting information.
RSA is a public-key crypto system that was developed in 1977 by Ronald
Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The algorithm is named after
the first letter of each of their last names. RSA is widely used in
information security systems to encrypt and decrypt data.
The RSA algorithm is based on the mathematical properties of large
prime numbers and thedifficulty of factoring them. The algorithm
uses a pair of keys, including a public key and a private key, to encrypt
and decrypt messages.
The public key is used to encrypt messages, and only the owner of the
private key can decrypt those messages.
The private key is used to decrypt messages, and only the owner of the
private key can possess that key.
The RSA algorithm is considered one of the most secure and reliable
public-key encryption algorithms, and it is widely used in various
applications, including email passwords, access authentication, data
encryption, and many other security systems.
In this paper, I provide a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's
history, properties, and applications.Secure communication: The RSA algorithm is
widely used in secure communication protocols to
ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data
transmitted over the internet.
It isused in protocols such as SSL/TLS, SSH, and
PGP to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Digital signatures: The RSA algorithm can be
used to create digital signatures, which are used to
verify the authenticity and integrity of digital
documents. A digital signature is createdby
encrypting a message digest with the sender's
private key. The recipient can verify the signature
by decrypting it with the sender's public key.
Key exchange: The RSA algorithm can be used
for key exchange in symmetric-key cryptography.
Two parties can use the RSA algorithm to
exchange a shared secret key withoutt
